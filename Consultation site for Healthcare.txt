1. Introduction
The Online Healthcare Consultation System is a web-based platform designed to simplify and digitize the interaction between patients and doctors. In today’s fast-paced world, accessing timely healthcare can be challenging due to distance, busy schedules. This system aims to solve those issues by allowing patients to book appointments, consult doctors, and receive digital prescriptions from the comfort of their homes.

The system supports three main types of users:
- Patients: who can register, search for doctors, and book appointments.
- Doctors: who can manage their availability, consult patients, and provide prescriptions.
- Admins: who monitor the overall system and manage users and appointments.
